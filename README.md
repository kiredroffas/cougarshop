For this project, I created a mockup of a "Cougar Shop" webpage using semantic UI (semantic-ui.com), HTML, and CSS stlying.

Components include: 
                    Top Menubar:    Social media icon links
                                    My Cart dropdown
                                    Contrasting background color
                                    
                    Middle Section: Fixed size centered logo
                                    Centered menu items - four menu items are dropdown showing specific menus when clicked
                                    Resizable campus image that adjusts automatically to take the full width of the page
                                    
                    Footer:         Darker background color
                                    Bottom and Top padding
                                    three column grid - each column has horizontal rule and a list of items
                                    bigger social media icons - inverted color
